# Manga Tracker

A MERN (MongoDB, Express, Reactjs, Nodejs) stack project I created to track my manga reading.
Using a spreadsheet was convenient at first but the slow start times paired with the repeitive tasks that could easily be automated or simplified (tracker read chapters, links for next chapters etc) motivated me to create my own. 

## TO-DO

* backend: login, change(put), delete, input validation

* notifications for front end

* react router(user ? main : login) + code splitting

* hide option for manga, add hidden / all / future (havent started) page to router

* different sorting options

* data persistance with mongodb

* backend with graphql

* dark mode toggle + front end design

* backend auto finds the next link based on finished chapter

* set up linting

* write test code in jest and cypress

* deployment pipeline with github actions deploy to heroku
