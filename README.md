# Manga Tracker

A MERN (MongoDB, Express, Reactjs, Nodejs) stack project I created to track my manga reading.
I was using a spreadsheet as my tracker solution at first but a few problems became apparent:
* Slow start time
* Repetive tasks
    * Updating chapters
    * Updating link for next chapter
* Tasks that could be automated
    * Link for next chapter
    * Opening up next 3 chapters at once
* Hard to add to / modify future reading list

To solve the above problems, I decided to create my own tracker. 
## TO-DO

* identify MVP then extra features, move to-do to github actions kanban

* when to add mongoDB?

* backend: login, change(put), delete, input validation

* notifications for front end

* react router(user ? main : login) + code splitting

* hide option for manga, add hidden / all / future (havent started) page to router

* different sorting options

* data persistance with mongodb

* backend with graphql

* dark mode toggle + front end design

* backend auto finds the next link based on finished chapter

* set up linting

* write test code in jest and cypress

* deployment pipeline with github actions deploy to heroku
