# Manga Tracker

A  project I created to track my manga reading.
I was using a spreadsheet as my tracker solution at first but a few problems became apparent:
* Slow start time
* Repetive tasks
    * Updating chapters
    * Updating link for next chapter
* Tasks that could be automated
    * Link for next chapter
    * Opening up next 3 chapters at once
* Hard to add to / modify future reading list

To solve the above problems, I decided to create my own tracker.

It is now deployed at:
